To run Repast HPC models please install Repast HPC from https://repast.github.io and change the PATHs in the makefile accordingly. 

run.sh scripts in the folders run the models with different configurations and generates the output for each process and each random seed.

Ordered folder has the ordered example in the paper (uses the same order of execution for egents at each time tick). 

Shuffled folder shuffles the agents at each time tick having different order of execution. 

Shuffled_layered uses the value layers solution of Repast HPC to provide consistent results.

Ross_Model has the model implemented with ROSS - Discrete event example.
